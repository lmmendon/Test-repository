# Test-repository
My first repository! An attempt to get familiar with Github and it's workings. 
And this is me editing my read-me! How very exciting, I feel pretty smart already, heh. 
I'm on Github for a Psych course in my university on coding! I'm really looking forward to this class and learning how to code. Aight, let's go bois!!
